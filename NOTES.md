Goal is to do a complete fullstack application ONLY with Javascript. No frameworks. No bundlers. No webpack.
Same core logic will be agnostic of frontend render.

## Pre-reqs:
Node.js, VSCode, Terminal w Unix support

The patterns we're going to learn and cover will map to other languages/frameworks.

Different APIs by environments: browser DOM API, Node.js FileSystem API, Mobile Sensors API

re: Bundlers
https://byteofdev.com/posts/bundlers/

DOM:
<script type="module" src="index.js">

OS:
//package.json
{type: "module"}


## Design Patterns for Javascript:
Use Abstract Factory pattern to have a Controller handle platform identification.

## Roadmap:
  Building the Interfact
  Shared Layer
  Publishing on Github Pages
